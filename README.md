# Arbitrary Code Gold and Silver
This repository contains my collection of arbitrary code executed via glitches in Gold and Silver.

Initial setup for all scripts will be found in Bootstrap.asm. The arbitrary code itself can be found in the src folder.

All files should be assembled and linked using rgbasm, which can be found here:
