# Arbitrary Code Gold and Silver
This repository contains my collection of arbitrary code executed via glitches in Gold and Silver.

Initial setup for all scripts will be found in Bootstrap.asm. The arbitrary code itself can be found in the src folder.

Every source file has the ingame actions required to set it up commented out. You can assemble and link it yourself to verify the output or to make changes to the code. All files should be assembled and linked using rgbds, which can be found here:
